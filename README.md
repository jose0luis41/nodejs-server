# nodejs-server

This project was made with nodeJS, to create the services that I used in the Front-end project.

## Development server

Run `node script.js` for a dev server. Backend will be automatically running.

## Database setup

Name the database "takumDB", or change the name whitin script.js by new one instead the current name.
