# nodejs-server

This project was made with nodeJS, to create the services that I used in the Front-end project.

## Development server

Run `node script.js` for a dev server. Backend will be automatically running.

## Database setup

Name the database `takumDB` or change the name whitin script.js file by new one instead the current name. You have to set the values "password" and "database" inside it if ypu create a new database with other name.
